## Introduction

This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. The pipeline is designed to process BAM files from RNA-seq experiments, perform transcript quantification, and generate gene expression matrices for downstream analysis. It utilizes state-of-the-art tools and follows best practices in the field of RNA-seq analysis.

The pipeline is optimized for use on high-performance computing clusters that use the SLURM workload manager, making it suitable for processing large-scale RNA-seq datasets efficiently.

## Pipeline Overview

Our pipeline consists of the following main steps:

1. **Reference Preparation**: Download and prepare reference genome, annotation files, and transcriptome.
2. **Index Generation**: Create a Salmon index for efficient transcript quantification.
3. **Transcript Quantification**: Use Salmon to quantify transcript expression from BAM files.
4. **Expression Matrix Generation**: Aggregate transcript-level quantifications to gene-level counts and TPM (Transcripts Per Million) values.

The pipeline uses the following key tools:

- **Salmon**: For fast and accurate transcript quantification
- **gffread**: To generate transcriptome sequences from genome and annotation files
- **R** with **tximport**: For aggregating transcript-level quantifications to gene-level counts

## Prerequisites

To run this pipeline, you need:

1. Access to a Linux-based high-performance computing environment with SLURM
2. Anaconda or Miniconda installed
3. R (version 3.6 or higher)
4. Input BAM files from your RNA-seq experiments

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bulk-rnaseq-pipeline.git
cd bulk-rnaseq-pipeline

2. Create and activate the conda environment:
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate rnaseq_env

3. Ensure you have the necessary R packages installed:
```R
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install(c("tximport", "readr", "dplyr"))
Usage

Edit the complete_rnaseq_pipeline.sh script to set your project-specific parameters:

BASE_DIR: Path to your project directory
SLURM parameters (nodes, tasks, CPUs, memory, etc.)
Email for job notifications


Make the script executable:
chmod +x complete_rnaseq_pipeline.sh
Submit the job to SLURM:
sbatch complete_rnaseq_pipeline.sh
Pipeline Steps

Download Reference Files:

Reference genome (GRCh38 no-alt analysis set)
Gene annotation (GENCODE v36)
Generate transcript-to-gene mapping file


Generate Transcriptome:

Use gffread to create a transcriptome FASTA file from the genome and annotation


Create Salmon Index:

Build an index of the transcriptome for efficient quantification


Salmon Quantification:

Process each BAM file with Salmon to quantify transcript expression
Apply GC bias and sequence-specific bias correction


Create Sample Sheet:

Generate a file listing all processed samples and their quantification files


Generate Count Matrices:

Use R and tximport to create gene-level count and TPM matrices



Output Files
The pipeline generates the following key output files:

gene_count_matrix.csv: A matrix of raw gene counts for all samples
gene_tpm_matrix.csv: A matrix of TPM-normalized gene expression values for all samples
Individual Salmon quantification directories for each sample
samples.txt: A sample sheet listing all processed samples

Customization
You can customize the pipeline by modifying the complete_rnaseq_pipeline.sh script. Common customizations include:

Adjusting SLURM parameters for your computing environment
Changing the reference genome or annotation versions
Modifying Salmon parameters for specific analysis needs
Altering the R script to perform additional downstream analyses

Troubleshooting
Common issues and their solutions:

Missing reference files: Ensure you have internet access to download reference files, or manually place them in the BASE_DIR.
Insufficient disk space: Check that your project directory has enough space for reference files and output.
Memory errors: Adjust the --mem parameter in the SLURM header if you encounter out-of-memory errors.
Missing R packages: Ensure all required R packages are installed in your conda environment.

We hope this pipeline proves useful for your RNA-seq analysis needs. Happy sequencing!
This README provides a comprehensive overview of your RNA-seq analysis pipeline. It includes detailed information about the pipeline's purpose, components, installation process, usage instructions, and output. The structure is designed to be easily navigable, with a table of contents and clear section headers.

To make it even more appealing on GitHub:

1. Consider adding some badges at the top of the README (e.g., license, version, build status).
2. You could include some images or diagrams to illustrate the pipeline workflow.
3. If you have example data or test cases, mention them in the README and provide instructions on how to run them.
4. You might want to add a section on citing this work if it's used in academic research.

Remember to replace placeholders like `[Your Name]`, `[your.email@example.com]`, and `[Your Institution]` with your actual information. Also, make sure to create and include the `LICENSE.md` file if you mention it in the README.

This README should provide a good starting point for documenting your pipeline on GitHub. Feel free to adjust it as needed to best represent your specific project and its requirements.
